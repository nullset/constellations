- A class is just an array of different mixins, all smashed together.
- Each mixin should define a unique `Symbol()` for the mixin's own internal name and state.
  - If no Symbol is defined, then generate one automatically (essentially becomes impossible to access at this point).
- Each mixin can access the "master" state (element.$), or its own internal state (element[SymbolName].$).
- Each state object is an observable.
